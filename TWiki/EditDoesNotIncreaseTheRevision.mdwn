## <a name="FAQ:"></a> FAQ:

Why does the topic revision not increase when I edit a topic?

## <a name="Answer:"></a> Answer:

The same topic revision will be used when you save a topic again within a certain time frame (one hour by default, configurable with configure item `{ReplaceIfEditedAgainWithin}`). This is to prevent unnecessary topic revisions when you do several edit cycles in a row. Note that a new revision **_is_** created if another person edits the same topic, regardless of the time.
