# <a name="Package &lt;code&gt;TWiki::Store::_QueryAlg"></a> Package =TWiki::Store::QueryAlgorithms::BruteForce

Default brute-force query algorithm

Has some basic optimisation: it hoists regular expressions out of the query to use with grep, so we can narrow down the set of topics that we have to evaluate the query on.

Not sure exactly where the breakpoint is between the costs of hoisting and the advantages of hoisting. Benchmarks suggest that it's around 6 topics, though this may vary depending on disk speed and memory size. It also depends on the complexity of the query.
